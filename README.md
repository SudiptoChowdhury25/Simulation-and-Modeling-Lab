# Assignment 1 - 
## Details:
### **Task 1:**
- Generate two vectors with 15 random floats each.
- Plot them on the same graph.
- Label the axes and add a title.

### **Task 2:**
- Create a 4x4 matrix with random values.
- Visualize it as a heatmap.
- Label the rows and columns.

### **Task 3:**
- Generate two 4x4 matrices with random values.
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Visualize the results using bar plots.
- Discuss the effects of these operations.

## Concepts Covered:
- Matrix operations using NumPy (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Heatmap representation of matrices
- Using bar plots to analyze matrix operations

## What I Learned:
- How to generate and manipulate matrices using NumPy.
- The importance of matrix operations in data processing.
- Data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Managing and submitting assignments using GitHub for version control.


# Assignment 2 -  

## Details:  
- Generate a **3Ã—3 matrix** of random integers between **1 and 50** using NumPy.  
- Run the code **twice**:  
  1. **With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`)** to ensure the same output on every run.  
  2. **Without setting a seed**, allowing random values to change each time.  
- Observe and explain the differences in outputs.  

## Concepts Covered:  
- NumPy random number generation using `np.random.randint()`.  
- Using `np.random.seed()` for reproducibility.  
- Understanding the difference between fixed and non-fixed random states.  

## What I Learned:  
- How `np.random.seed()` ensures consistency in random number generation.  
- The role of randomness in programming and why reproducibility is important.  
- The impact of not setting a seed, resulting in different outputs on each run.
